Here I have created two projects:
1) A Number Guessing Game using Java Programming. Here the player gets 10 chances to guess a number between 1 to 100. If the guess is correct at the very first attempt, then the player gets a score. If the guess of the player is smaller or greater than the actual answer, the player is provided a hint accoring to it and is provided another chance to guess it right. If the payer is unable to guess the answer in all the 10 chances, then the plyer is awarded 0 points.
2) An ATM Interface using Java Programming. Here the user needs to enter his/her User Id and PIN to login in their account. Incorrect User ID or PIN will show a message. After succesfull login, the uswer can perform operations like DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, TRANSFER, SHOW TRANSACTION HISTORY and QUIT.
